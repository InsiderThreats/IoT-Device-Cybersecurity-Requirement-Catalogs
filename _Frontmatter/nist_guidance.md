# NIST Guidance
NIST has developed extensive guidance over the years for cybersecurity, which also supports implementation of the [Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management). The guidance developed to support FISMA implementation is designed to be technology neutral so it can be applied to any type of system, from the risk management framework ([NIST SP 800-37, Revision 2](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final)) methodology to manage risk to the security and privacy controls ([NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)) that identify the countermeasures and outcomes to protect information, systems, and the privacy of individuals. However, there is the opportunity to provide additional guidance to assist federal organizations in understanding the specific risks that IoT devices introduce into federal systems and organizations.
To that end, the program has developed a family of documents to provide that guidance:

* Overall guidance for federal agencies seeking to integrate IoT devices into their systems and infrastructures is provided in SP 800-213, _IoT Device Cybersecurity Guidance for the Federal Government_. The SP has background and recommendations to help federal agencies consider how an IoT device they plan to acquire can integrate into a federal information system. IoT devices and their support for security controls are presented in the context of organizational and system risk management. SP 800-213 provides guidance on considering system security from the device perspective. This allows for the identification of device cybersecurity requirements—the abilities and actions a federal agency will expect from an IoT device and its manufacturer and/or third parties, respectively.

* [NISTIR 8259](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8259/final) provides manufacturers with guidance for identifying an initial core baseline of device cybersecurity capabilities and foundational activities to consider throughout the product development process. The core baseline and foundational activities are intended to help IoT device manufacturers make their IoT devices securable, giving IoT device customers the cybersecurity capabilities to meet their security goals.

* NISTIRs [8259A](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8259a/final) and 8259B are a complementary pair, providing balance in our treatment of technical and non-technical requirements, giving more comprehensive guidance for manufacturers executing the six activities called out in NISTIR 8259.  NISTIR 8259B complements the NISTIR 8259A device cybersecurity core baseline by detailing additional, non-technical supporting activities typically needed from manufacturers and/or associated third parties. This non-technical baseline collects and makes explicit support capabilities like documentation, training, etc. 

* NISTIR 8259C describes a process, usable by any organization, that starts with the core baselines provided in NISTIR 8259A and 8259B and explains how to integrate those baselines with organization- or application-specific requirements (e.g., industry standards, regulatory guidance) to develop a IoT cybersecurity profile suitable for specific IoT device customers or applications. The process in NISTIR 8259C guides organizations needing to create a more detailed set of capabilities responding to the concerns of a specific sector, based on some authoritative source such as a standard or other guidance, and could be used by organizations seeking to procure IoT technology or by manufacturers looking to match their products to customer requirements. This method was used to create the profile meeting the requirements of the federal information system low baseline that’s provided [SP 800-53B](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53b/final), _Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations_.

* NISTIR 8259D provides a worked-example result of applying the NISTIR 8259C process, focused on the federal government customer space, where the requirements of the FISMA process and the SP 800-53 security and privacy controls catalog are the essential guidance. NISTIR 8259D provides a device-centric, cybersecurity-oriented profile of the core baselines, calibrated against the FISMA low baseline as an example of the criteria for minimal securability for federal use cases
