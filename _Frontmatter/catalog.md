# The Catalog

Based on the content of NISTIRs 8259A and 8259B, NIST has developed a catalog of IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical manufacturer capabilities and associated IoT device customer actions that are published on this site. NIST leveraged the core baseline established in NISTIRs 8259A and 8259B, and analyzed the controls found in NIST SP 800-53 to develop a catalog of key IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical manufacturer capabilities to ensure that customers’ systems meet an established level of management, operational, and technical security control requirements. The catalog contains more granular capability statements that refine and add specificity to the high-level capabilities defined in the NISTIRs. 

Manufacturers can engineer their IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities and provide non-technical capabilities to IoT device customers, who can then use those capabilities to ensure their systems meet an established level of management, operational and technical security control requirements. The capabilities needed for each IoT device will depend upon the risks that the device brings to the system within which it is implemented. The profile development process described in NISTIR 8259C explains how customer organizations or manufacturers can use the catalog as a tool to determine the appropriate set of requirements for a particular use case or operational need.
This catalog identifies technical and non-technical capabilities necessary for addressing context-specific security requirements, such as the NIST SP 800-53 controls that apply to federal information systems. Just as not every Federal IT system uses every control, not every capability in the catalog is needed in every IoT device. Profiles can be created to identify the default minimum set of technical and non-technical capabilities necessary when integrating IoT devices into specific environments (e.g., healthcare, public safety). The Federal profile contained in NISTIR 8259D is a worked example that may also be useful to non-Federal organizations, or they may choose to create their own baseline profiles by choosing a different set of capabilities and elements from the catalog.

## Device [Technical] Cybersecurity Capability Catalog

**NOTE TO VISITORS:**  NIST published its [original catalog](https://pages.nist.gov/FederalProfile-8259A/) of device [technical] cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical capabilities in June 2020. As the work progressed on our recently released publications, we identified opportunities to refine the catalog structure and content. We are temporarily posting the content of the original catalog here, as-is, until new versions are completed and ready to be posted.  

This catalog section presents a collection of IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities that expand on the baseline set of capabilities defined in [NISTIR 8259A, _IoT Device Cybersecurity Capability Core Baseline_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8259A.pdf).  The NISTIR defines an IoT device cybersecurity capability core baseline, which is a set of device capabilities generally needed to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organization’s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems, providing a starting point to use in identifying the device cybersecurity capabilities for IoT devices. Device cybersecurity capabilities are cybersecurity features or functions that computing devices provide through their own technical means (i.e., device hardware and software). The seven device cybersecurity capabilities are:

> **_Editor’s Note:_** _the capabilities labels below should be converted to links to the associated section of the catalog once the new version is published._

* **Device Identification:** The IoT device can be uniquely identified logically and physically.

* **Device Configuration:** The configuration of the IoT device’s software can be changed, and such changes can be performed by authorized entities only.

* **Data Protection:** The IoT device can protect the data it stores and transmits from unauthorized access and modification.

* **Logical Access to Interfaces:** The IoT device can restrict logical access to its local and network interfaces, and the protocols and services used by those interfaces, to authorized entities only.

* **Software Update:** The IoT device’s software can be updated by authorized entities only using a secure and configurable mechanism.

* **Cybersecurity State Awareness:** The IoT device can report on its cybersecurity state and make that information accessible to authorized entities only.

* **Device Security:** The IoT device can operate securely by protecting its hardware and software integrity and securely utilizing system resources, managing communications, and executing code.

This on-line catalog enumerates specific IoT device abilities associated with each of the capabilities listed above. The abilities were developed by applying an IoT focus to the security and privacy controls contained in NIST SP 800-53 to arrive at specific ability statements. As not every ability listed here is applicable to every situation, this catalog should be viewed as a collection of abilities that can be filtered down to a profile suitable for a particular use case, industry sector, or customer organization, as described in NISTIR 8259C, _Creating a Profile Using the IoT Core Baseline and Non-Technical Baseline._

## Non-Technical Supporting Capability Catalog

**NOTE TO VISITORS:**  NIST published its [original catalog](https://pages.nist.gov/FederalProfile-8259A/) of device [technical] cybersecurity capabilities and supporting non-technical capabilities in June 2020. As the work progressed on our recently released publications, we identified opportunities to refine the catalog structure and content. We are temporarily posting the content of the original catalog here, as-is, until new versions are completed and ready to be posted.  

This catalog section presents a collection of non-technical supporting capabilities that expand on the baseline set of capabilities defined in NISTIR 8259B, _IoT Non-Technical Supporting Capability Core Baseline_.  The NISTIR defines an Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers’ non-technical supporting capability core baseline, which is a set of non-technical supporting capabilities generally needed from manufacturers or other third parties to support common cybersecurity controls that protect an organization’s devices as well as device data, systems, and ecosystems. The baseline provides a starting point to use in identifying a set of detailed actions that implement the device non-technical support capabilities in the baseline. The four non-technical supporting capabilities are:

> **_Editor’s Note:_** _the capabilities labels below should be converted to links to the associated section of the catalog once the new version is published._

* **Documentation:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create, gather, and store information relevant to cybersecurity of the IoT device throughout the development of a device and its subsequent lifecycle.  

* **Information and Query Reception:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to receive from the customer information and queries related to cybersecurity of the IoT device.

* **Information Dissemination:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to broadcast and distribute information related to cybersecurity of the IoT device. 

* **Education and Awareness:** The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create awareness of and educate customers about cybersecurity-related information, considerations, features, etc. of the IoT device. 

This on-line catalog enumerates specific activities associated with each of the four non-technical supporting capabilities listed above. These actions were identified by applying an IoT focus to the security and privacy controls contained in NIST SP 800-53 to arrive at specific ability statements. As not every action listed here is applicable to every situation, this catalog should be viewed as a collection of non-technical supporting capabilities that can be filtered down to a profile suitable for a particular use case, industry sector, or customer organization, as described in NISTIR 8259C, _Creating a Profile Using the IoT Core Baseline and Non-Technical Baseline._
