# NIST Informative References

The NIST Cybersecurity for IoT team has mapped the detailed device cybersecurity capabilities and non-technical supporting capabilities contained in this catalog to the security and privacy controls of NIST SP 800-53 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The mappings provide greater clarity for how the catalog capabilities support specific controls (SP 800-53) and Functions, Categories, and Subcategories (CSF). The mappings are provided in downloadable format.
